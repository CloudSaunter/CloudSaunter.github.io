# Cost Optimization on Google Cloud


One of the primary benefits of cloud computing is its ability to reduce costs by eliminating the need for on-premises hardware and infrastructure. However, as your usage of cloud services increases, so does the potential for costs to spiral out of control. In this blog post, we'll explore some tips and strategies for optimizing cost with Google Cloud Platform.

1. Use Google's pricing calculator
Google offers a pricing calculator that allows you to estimate the cost of using various GCP services based on your expected usage. You can use this tool to compare the costs of different services and configurations and make informed decisions about which ones to use.
2. Use committed use discounts
Google Cloud Platform offers significant discounts for customers who commit to using certain services for a set period of time, typically one to three years. These discounts can be as high as 55%, so it's worth considering if you're planning to use a particular service for an extended period of time.
3. Use preemptible instances
Preemptible instances are virtual machines that run on spare capacity and can be shut down at any time by Google. They're significantly cheaper than regular instances, but the trade-off is that they're not suitable for workloads that require high availability or long-running tasks.
4. Use resource quotas
Google Cloud Platform allows you to set quotas on the resources you use, such as the number of virtual machines, CPU usage, and network bandwidth. By setting quotas, you can limit the amount of resources that can be consumed by a particular project or user and avoid unexpected costs.
5. Monitor and optimize usage
Google Cloud Platform provides a suite of tools for monitoring and optimizing your usage, such as Stackdriver for logging and monitoring and Cloud Optimization for cost optimization recommendations. By regularly reviewing your usage and making adjustments where necessary, you can avoid overprovisioning resources and reduce costs.
6. Choose the right storage options
Google Cloud Platform offers a variety of storage options, such as standard, nearline, coldline, and archive storage. Each option has a different cost and access time, so it's important to choose the right option for your use case. For example, if you're storing data that you rarely access, you could save money by using coldline or archive storage.

1. [**Auto Scaling:**](#auto-scaling) Auto Scaling is a feature in Google Cloud Platform that automatically adjusts the number of compute resources in response to changes in demand. By configuring Auto Scaling policies based on usage patterns, you can ensure that you're only using the resources you need, which can help reduce costs.
2. [**Serverless Computing:**](#serverless-computing) Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically scales resources based on usage. By leveraging serverless computing platforms like Google Cloud Functions or Cloud Run, you can optimize your costs by only paying for the compute time you actually use.
3. [**Scheduled Shutdowns:**](#scheduled-shutdowns) You can also use automation to shut down non-critical resources during off-hours or non-business days. By scheduling the shutdown and startup of compute resources, you can reduce your costs by not paying for unused resources when they are not needed.
4. [**Auto Provisioning:**](#auto-provisioning) Auto Provisioning allows you to automatically spin up new compute resources when usage exceeds a certain threshold. By setting up auto-provisioning, you can ensure that you always have enough compute resources to handle spikes in demand without overspending on resources that are not needed.
5. [**Resource Optimization:**](#resource-optimization) Google Cloud Platform offers various services and tools for analyzing your usage patterns and identifying areas where you can optimize your resources. You can use automation to implement these recommendations automatically, ensuring that you're using the most cost-effective resources at all times.


Automation is a powerful tool for achieving cost optimization in Google Cloud Platform. By leveraging automation features like Auto Scaling, Serverless Computing, Scheduled Shutdowns, Auto Provisioning, and Resource Optimization, you can optimize your cloud costs and maximize the value of your investment in Google Cloud Platform.

### Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling policies can be based on a variety of metrics, such as CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom metrics that you define. When a threshold is exceeded, Auto Scaling will automatically add new compute resources to handle the increased demand, and when demand decreases, it will automatically remove the excess resources to save on costs.
Auto Scaling is particularly useful for applications that experience unpredictable spikes in traffic or usage, as it ensures that you always have enough compute resources to handle the increased load without overspending on resources that are not needed during periods of low demand.

### Auto Provisioning

Auto Provisioning policies can be based on a variety of metrics, such as CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom metrics that you define. When a threshold is exceeded, Auto Provisioning will automatically spin up new compute resources to handle the increased demand, and when demand decreases, it will automatically terminate the excess resources to save on costs.
Auto Provisioning is particularly useful for applications that experience predictable spikes in traffic or usage, such as during peak business hours or seasonal events. By automatically provisioning resources as needed, you can ensure that your application always performs optimally without overspending on resources that are not needed during periods of low demand.

### Serverless computing

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically scales resources based on usage. In serverless computing, you only pay for the compute time you actually use, without having to manage and provision any infrastructure.
Serverless computing platforms like Google Cloud Functions or Cloud Run can help you optimize your costs by reducing the amount of compute resources needed to run your application. Here's how serverless computing can be used for cost optimization:

1. Pay only for what you use: With serverless computing, you only pay for the compute time you actually use. This means that you don't have to pay for idle resources, which can help reduce your costs.
2. Automatic scaling: Serverless computing platforms automatically scale resources based on demand. This means that you don't have to manually provision or manage any infrastructure, which can save you time and money.
3. No server maintenance: With serverless computing, the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, including server maintenance, security, and updates. This means that you don't have to spend time or resources managing your own servers.
4. Reduced development time: Serverless computing allows you to focus on developing your application, without having to worry about managing and scaling infrastructure. This can help reduce your development time and costs.
5. Cost-effective for low-traffic applications: Serverless computing can be particularly cost-effective for applications with low or sporadic traffic. Because you only pay for the compute time you use, you can save money compared to traditional compute resources.

### Scheduled Shutdowns

Scheduled shutdowns are a useful cost optimization strategy that can be employed on Google Cloud Platform to help reduce unnecessary costs associated with running idle or unused resources. A scheduled shutdown is a process of automatically shutting down non-essential resources during non-business hours or times when they are not being utilized, such as weekends or holidays. To implement scheduled shutdowns on Google Cloud Platform, you can use tools such as Cloud Scheduler, which allows you to schedule the shutdown and startup of resources at specific times. You can also use Google Cloud Functions to create custom scripts to automate the process of shutting down and starting up resources.
scheduled shutdowns are a powerful cost optimization strategy that can help you reduce your cloud spending and optimize your resources on Google Cloud Platform. By implementing scheduled shutdowns, you can save on costs, optimize your resources, improve security, and contribute to environmental sustainability.

### Resource Optimization

Resource optimization is the process of managing your cloud resources in a way that maximizes their efficiency and minimizes waste. In other words, it's about getting the most out of your resources while using as little as possible. Resource optimization is essential for cost optimization, as it helps reduce unnecessary expenses and improve overall efficiency.

There are several ways that resource optimization can be used for cost optimization on cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform:

1. Right-sizing: One way to optimize resources is to "right-size" them, which means adjusting the capacity of your resources to meet the demands of your workload. This can involve increasing or decreasing the capacity of your resources based on the current workload to avoid over-provisioning or under-provisioning.

2. Load balancing: Load balancing is another way to optimize resources by distributing the workload across multiple resources. This helps ensure that each resource is being utilized efficiently, and helps prevent overloading any one resource.
3. Automation: Automation is an important tool for optimizing resources, as it can help reduce human error and improve efficiency. For example, automating the provisioning and deprovisioning of resources can help ensure that you only pay for the resources that you need when you need them.
4. Monitoring and analytics: Effective monitoring and analytics can help you identify opportunities for optimization by providing insights into resource utilization patterns and identifying areas of waste. This can help you make informed decisions about how to optimize your resources and reduce costs.

Resource optimization is a critical component of cost optimization on cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform. By right-sizing your resources, load balancing your workloads, automating resource management, and using monitoring and analytics tools, you can improve the efficiency of your resources, reduce waste, and save costs.
