# Why do we need Automation on cloud ?

Automation has become an integral part of modern businesses, providing a wide range of benefits such as increased efficiency, consistency, scalability, cost savings, and improved security. In this essay, we will explore these benefits and provide practical examples of how automation can be implemented in the context of Google Cloud.

One of the most significant benefits of automation is increased efficiency. When it comes to cloud infrastructure provisioning, automation can significantly reduce the time and effort required to create and manage resources. For instance, Google Cloud provides a service called Cloud Deployment Manager that allows users to define infrastructure as code, making it easy to create and manage complex cloud environments. This service automates the process of creating and managing resources, ensuring that infrastructure is consistent and reliable every time.

Similarly, automation can be used to streamline software delivery, making it faster and more reliable. For instance, Google Cloud provides a service called Cloud Build that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software. This service allows developers to quickly and easily create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys code changes to the cloud environment.

Consistency is another significant benefit of automation. By automating routine tasks, businesses can ensure that their systems are always running smoothly and that changes are implemented consistently across all environments. For instance, Google Cloud provides a service called Cloud Functions that allows users to create serverless functions that can be triggered by various events. This service automates the process of running code in response to events, ensuring that functions are executed consistently and reliably.

Scalability is yet another benefit of automation. As businesses grow, they need to be able to handle larger workloads without needing to hire additional staff. Automation can help businesses achieve this by reducing the amount of time and effort required to complete tasks. For example, Google Cloud provides a service called Cloud Run that allows users to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. This service makes it easy to scale applications automatically, based on demand.

Cost savings are also a significant benefit of automation. By reducing the amount of time and effort required to complete tasks, businesses can save money on staffing costs. Additionally, automation can help businesses avoid costly mistakes that could result in downtime or other issues. For instance, Google Cloud provides a service called Cloud Logging that allows users to monitor logs across all their cloud resources. This service automates the process of collecting and analyzing logs, making it easier to detect and resolve issues before they become a problem.

Finally, automation can help businesses improve security by enforcing security policies and ensuring that infrastructure and software deployments are secure by default. For example, Google Cloud provides a service called Cloud Security Command Center that provides centralized visibility and control over security across all cloud resources. This service automates the process of identifying and remediating security issues, reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.

In conclusion, automation provides a wide range of benefits for businesses, including increased efficiency, consistency, scalability, cost savings, and improved security. By leveraging services such as Cloud Deployment Manager, Cloud Build, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Cloud Logging, and Cloud Security Command Center, businesses can automate routine tasks and streamline their operations, allowing them to focus on innovation and growth.
